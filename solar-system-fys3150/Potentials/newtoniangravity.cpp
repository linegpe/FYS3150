     *      a.getMass();       b.getMass();

     * Particle::addForce method.
     *
     * Since calculating the forces between a and b almost inevitably involves
     * calculating the potential energy, V(r), it is assumed by the Potential
     * class that this quantity is calculated here and added to the
     * m_potentialEnergy variable. Note: You may skip this until you have a
     * working two-body problem, since the calculation of the potential energy
     * is only neccessary for verification purposes later.
